## What is a shell?
A shell is a program that takes the command inputs written from the the userâ€™s keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel. It also verifies if the command inputs from the user are correct.

![A shell is a messanger between the user, the kernel and the machine.](./media/cli-flow.webp)

So, in general, a Shell is a user interface to use the services of a computer.

## How the shell works

The shell follows a simple cycle:

1. **R**ead: Accept input from the user
2. **E**valuate: Interpret the command
3. **P**rint: Display the output
4. **L**oop: Return to step 1

### How hsh works
* Prints a prompt and waits for a command from the user.
* Creates a child process in which the command is checked.
* Checks for built-ins, aliases in the PATH, and local executable programs.
* The child process is replaced by the command, which accepts arguments.
* When the command is done, the program returns to the parent process and prints the prompt.
* The program is ready to receive a new command
* To exit: press Ctrl-D or enter "exit" (with or without a status).
* Works also in non interactive mode.

## Description

**hsh** is a simple UNIX command language interpreter developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It mimics the basic functionality of the Bash shell, providing a command-line interface for users to interact with their system.

## Features

- Executes commands from files or standard input
- Supports built-in commands like `cd`, `exit`, `env`, `setenv`, and `unsetenv`
- Handles command separators (`;`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`)
- Manages environment variables
- Supports comments (lines starting with `#`)
- Works in both interactive and non-interactive modes

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Linux environment (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS recommended)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackerSa3edy/simple_shell.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd simple_shell
```

3. Compile the program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
Run the shell:
```bash
./hsh
```

You will see a prompt where you can type commands:

```bash
$ ls -l
$ pwd
$ echo Hello, World!
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
Execute commands from a file:

```bash
./hsh < commands.txt
```

Or pipe commands to the shell:

```bash
echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
```

## Built-in Commands

- `cd [DIRECTORY]`: Change the current directory
- `exit [STATUS]`: Exit the shell with a given status
- `env`: Print the current environment
- `setenv [VARIABLE] [VALUE]`: Set an environment variable
- `unsetenv [VARIABLE]`: Unset an environment variable

## Environment

The shell uses the following environment variables:

- `HOME`: The home directory of the current user
- `PWD`: The current working directory
- `OLDPWD`: The previous working directory
- `PATH`: A colon-separated list of directories to search for commands

## Exit Status

**hsh** returns the exit status of the last command executed, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure.

If a command is not found, the return status is `127`; if a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).

## Signals

While running in interactive mode, **hsh** ignores the keyboard input `Ctrl+c`. Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (`Ctrl+d`) will exit the program.

User hits `Ctrl+d` in the third line.
```
$ ./hsh
$ ^C
$ ^C
$
```

## Command Execution

Upon receiving a command, **hsh** tokenizes it into words using spaces as delimiters. The first word is interpreted as the command, while all subsequent words are treated as arguments. **hsh** then proceeds with the following steps:

1. If the command doesn't begin with a slash (`/`) or dot (`.`), the shell first checks its list of built-in functions. If a matching built-in is found, it is executed.

2. If the command doesn't start with a slash (`/`), dot (`.`), and isn't a built-in function, **hsh** searches for an executable file with the command name in each directory listed in the **PATH** environment variable.

3. If the command begins with a slash (`/`) or dot (`.`), or if either of the above searches succeeds, the shell executes the specified program with any provided arguments in a separate execution environment.


## Operators

- `;`: Command separator
- `&&`: AND logical operator
- `||`: OR logical operator

## Examples

### Using command separator

```bash
$ echo Hello ; ls
```
```
# Output
Hello
file1 file2 file3
```

### Using AND operator

```bash
$ mkdir test && cd test && pwd
```
```
# Output
/home/user/test
```

### Using OR operator

```bash
$ ls /nonexistent || echo "Directory not found"
```
```
# Output
Directory not found
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Command not found**: Ensure the command exists and is in your PATH
- **Permission denied**: Check if you have the necessary permissions to execute the file
- **Syntax errors**: Verify your command syntax, especially when using operators
